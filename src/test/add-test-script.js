// This is a helper script to add test script to package.json
// In a real-world scenario, you would directly edit package.json,
// but since we can't do that directly, we're keeping this script
// as a reminder of what needs to be added:
//
// Add to package.json scripts section:
// "test": "jest",
// "test:watch": "jest --watch",
// "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
